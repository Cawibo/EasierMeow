# EasierMeow
My first time writing code in Rust. Preq. knowledge include, and is mostly limited to, reading the documentation up-and-until structs. It has been quite the experience having to wade through the last couple of years' heated discussions and spontaneous deprecations. I set out to make at least something; and I believe that I have managed.

## What is EasierMeow
I've grown tired of having to set up my own testcases when doing Kattis-assignments. In my dreams, this would be a git-like program for setting up and testing Kattis-specific environments. In its current state it is much less.
Give it a link to a Kattis-problem and it will set up main-file [only Python as of now] and test-files. Thought not very impressive, it is better than doing it manually.

## How to use [Winwdows only]
1. Create .exe-file from project using Cargo.
2. Set PATH to .exe-file
3. Move to appropriate folder and type `mjau init`
4. Follow instructions.
